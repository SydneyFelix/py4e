Nag punta na ako sa sales pero nung sinabi ko na mayroon din 
akong issue about refund, ayaw akong asikasuhin, pilit akong
pinapapunta sa main office sa ayala makati. Nag punta ako sa ayala office, 
Doon naman, ayaw rin naman akong i-refund. Kahit na inadmit niya na PLDT 
received double payment. Kahit na sinabi kong, inadvise 
na ako ng customer service na kunin yung refund ko dahil na doble na bayad sa PLDT. 
Tingin ko, she is preventing cash outflow and I understand that. 

In this case, therefore I propose, since you have received double payments 
from jan to july 2022 ( the payment by legato and the one i paid from my pocket), 
please consider my jan-july payments, my advance pay
ment for august 2022 to february 2023 thereby making me still having right access
to internet connection until february 2023. This way you don't need to refund me,
you can prevent cash outflow and you still maintain me as a customer. 
I hope by March 2023 you have already setup my own personal account so then when I
pay, It goes straight to my own personal account. 


The account is Legatto. Place where PLDT render internet connection, 
my(Sydney Abejar's) residence at 956 Basilan makati. Why? work from Home.

December 31, 2021 - Sydney ended employer employee relationship w/legato.
By then Legato should(but didn't) request PLDT to stop internet access to Sydney.
Sydney has also requested legato to submit request to PLDT to stop legatto's internet account.

On December(around 25-31) 2021, Sydney submitted applicaton to PLDT internet service on his own account, 
to start Jan 2022, but can't do so until legato has requested PLDT to stop internet access to sydney's residence.

Sydney, needing internet access, having no other recourse, continued paying the legato's account until it stop.
